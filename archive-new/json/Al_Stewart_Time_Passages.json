            "It was late in December, the sky turned to snow",
            "All round the day was goin' down slow",
            "Night like a river beginning to flow",
            "I felt the beat of my mind go",
            "Drifting into time passages",
            "Years go falling in the fading light",
            "Time passages",
            "Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight",
            "",
            "Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn",
            "Don't know why you should feel",
            "That there's something to learn",

            "Well I'm not the kind to live in the past",

            "Well it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these",
            "Time passages",
            "There's something back here that you left behind",
            "Oh, time passages",

            "",
            "Well the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd",
            "They're laughing at something, and the music's loud",
            "A girl comes towards you, you once used to know",
            "You reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these",

            "I know you're in there, you're just out of sight",
