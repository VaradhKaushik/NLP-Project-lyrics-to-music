            "Ah, but he calls them everynight",

            "When they had some more news they'd call",
            "And she told them when they found him",
            "To tell him that she loved him",
            "And she hung up the phone singing",
            "Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long",
            "Thinking nothing but the worst is coming",
            "With the ringing of the telephone",
            "Oh, but the man upstairs was listening",
            "When momma asked him to bring daddy home",
            "And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end",
            "Asking her if she had been singing the song, singing",
