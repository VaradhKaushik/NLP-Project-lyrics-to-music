            "In small town down in Georgia, over 40 years ago",
            "Her maiden name was Music 'til she met that Jackson boy",
            "They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name",
            "They believed the one you vowed to love should always stay the same",
            "",
            "And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation underway",
            "For a love to last forever, or until their dying days",
            "They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time",
            "And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind",
            "",
            "My mama raised five children, four girls and there was me",
            "She found her strength and faith in God and a love of family",
            "She never had a social life, home was all she knew",
            "Except the time she took a job to pay a bill or two",
            "My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired",
            "He never earned much money, but he gave us all he had",
            "He never made the front page, but he did the best he could",
            "Folks drove their cars from miles around to let him look underneath the hood",
            ""
