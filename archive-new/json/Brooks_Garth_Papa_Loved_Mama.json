            "Papa drove a truck nearly all his life",
            "You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife",
            "The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone",
            "I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone",
            "Papa called Mama each and every night",
            "Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright",
            "Mama would wait for that call to come in",
            "But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again",
            "",
            "Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did",
            "Papa came home and it was just us kids",
            "He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine",
            "If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine",
            "I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall",
            "Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall",
            "That old diesel engine made an eerie sound",
            "When Papa fired it up and headed into town"

            "Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined",
            "Papa was a good 'ne, but the jealous kind",

            "Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen",
