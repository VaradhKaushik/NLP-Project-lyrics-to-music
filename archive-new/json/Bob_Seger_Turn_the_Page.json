            "On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha",
            "You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song",
            "You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before",
            "But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do",
            "When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do",
            "And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through",
            "",
            "Well, you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road",
            "And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold",
            "You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode",
            "Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can",
            "All the same old clich\u00e9s, \"Is it woman, is it man?\"",
            "And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand",
            "Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away",
            "Every ounce of energy you try to give away",
            "As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play",
            "Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed",
            "With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head",
            "You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said",
