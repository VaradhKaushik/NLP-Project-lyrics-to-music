            "Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade",
            "Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made",
            "People passing by, they would stop and say",

            "His mother told him, \"Someday you will be a man",
            "And you will be the leader of a big ol' band",
            "Many people coming from miles around",
            "To hear you play your music when the sun go down",
