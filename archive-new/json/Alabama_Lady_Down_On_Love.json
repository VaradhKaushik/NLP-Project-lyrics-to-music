            "It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen",
            "A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams",
            "The ties that once bound her now are broke away",
            "And she's like a baby, just learning how to play",
            "She never thought that love could ever end so soon",
            "Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon",
            "When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay",
            "And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday",
            "",
            "Well, I know a lady that's down on her love",
            "'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch",
            "But work took me a way from home late at nights",
            "And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights",
            "Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust",
            "And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust",
