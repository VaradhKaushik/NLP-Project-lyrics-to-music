            "Made me sad to think it was dead",
            "After nine days I let the horse run free",
            "'Cause the desert had turned to sea",
            "There were plants and birds and rocks and things",
            "There was sand and hills and rings",
            "The ocean is a desert with its life underground",
            "And a perfect disguise above",
            "Under the cities lies a heart made of ground",
            "But the humans will give no love",
