            "I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be",

            "I feel like no one ever told the truth to me",
            "About growing up and what a struggle it would be",

            "I used to bring you sunshine",
            "Now all I ever do is bring you down",
            "How would it be if you were standing in my shoes?",
