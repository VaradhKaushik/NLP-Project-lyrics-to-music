            "I'm still loving you in a million ways",
            "",
            "Well the devil's in the alley, there's a mule kicking in my stall",
            "Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all",
            "I was raised in the country, I've been working in town",

            "",
            "Well I ain't got nothing for you, I had nothing before",
            "Don't even have anything for myself anymore",
            "The sky is full of fire, pain is pouring down",
            "There's nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around",

            "Well I got here following the Southern star",

            "Things should start to get interesting right about now",
            "My clothes are wet, tight on my skin",
            "Not as tight as the corner that I've painted myself in",
