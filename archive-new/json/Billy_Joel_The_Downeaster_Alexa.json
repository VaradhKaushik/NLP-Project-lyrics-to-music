            "There are giants out there in the canyons",
            "And a good captain can't fall asleep",
            "I got bills to pay and children who need clothes",
            "I know there's fish out there, but where God only knows",
            "They say these waters aren't what they used to be",

            "And I still have my hands on the wheel",
            "Now I drive my downeaster \"Alexa\"",
            "More and more miles from shore every year",
            "Since they told me I can't sell no stripers",
            "And there's no luck in swordfishing here",
            "I was a bayman like my father was before",

            "There ain't much future for a man who works the sea",
